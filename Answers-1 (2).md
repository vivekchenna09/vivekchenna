1. Import Necessary Tools: It starts by importing the tools it needs, like the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and mathematical functions.\
2. Load Inaugural Speeches: The script downloads and loads a collection of inaugural speeches given by U.S. presidents. These speeches are stored in a format that the script can work with.\
3.Define Search Queries: It defines five different topics as search queries. These topics are things like government budgets, foreign policy, economic growth, environmental protection, and civil rights.\
4. Create a Scoring Function: The script defines a function called `jm_smoothing`. This function calculates how relevant a document (speech) is to a query (topic) using a technique called Jelinek-Mercer smoothing.\
5. Rank Documents: Another function, `rank_documents`, is created to rank the speeches based on how well they match a given query. It calculates scores for each speech and sorts them from most to least relevant.\
6. Measure Precision: A function called `compute_precision_at_5` calculates something called "precision at 5." It measures how many of the top 5 ranked speeches are actually relevant to the query.\
7. Loop Over Queries: The script goes through each query (the topics mentioned earlier) and for each query, it calculates relevance scores for the speeches using two different methods (with different "lambda" values). It then shows the top 5 speeches for each query and how precise these rankings are.\
8. Output Results: The script prints out the results, including the top speeches for each query, their similarity scores, and how well they match the query's topic.\
In simpler terms, this script helps you find and rank historical presidential speeches based on how well they relate to specific topics. It also measures how accurate these rankings are, all using a mathematical technique called Jelinek-Mercer smoothing.\

The provided Python code performs the following tasks using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library and a Dirichlet Prior model to rank and retrieve the most similar inaugural addresses for a set of query terms:\
1. Import Necessary Libraries:\
   - The code begins by importing the required libraries, including NLTK, to perform text processing and ranking operations.\
2. Access Inaugural Addresses:\
   - It accesses a collection of inaugural addresses using the `inaugural` corpus from NLTK. These addresses are historic speeches given by U.S. Presidents during their inaugurations.\
3. Define Dirichlet Prior Parameters:\
   - Two values of "mu" are defined in the `mu_values` list. The Dirichlet Prior model uses these values to control the trade-off between document-specific term frequencies and the corpus-wide term frequencies when calculating document scores. Users can adjust these values as needed.\
4. Define Dirichlet Prior Score Calculation Function:\
   - The `dirichlet_score` function calculates the Dirichlet Prior score for a given term in a document. It takes the term frequency, document length, collection length, and the value of "mu" as input and returns the score.\
5. Calculate Document Lengths:\
   - The code calculates and stores the length (number of words) of each document in the `doc_lengths` dictionary.\
6. Calculate Term Frequencies:\
   - The code calculates and stores the term frequencies (word counts) for each term in each document in the `term_freqs` dictionary.\
7. Define Query Terms:\
   - A list of query terms (`queries`) is defined. These terms represent the words for which the system will retrieve relevant documents.\
8. Retrieve and Rank Documents for Each Query and Mu:\
   - The code enters a loop over the two values of "mu" defined in `mu_values`.\
   - For each "mu" value, it enters another loop over the query terms defined earlier.\
   - Inside the query loop, it computes a score for each document in the corpus for the current query term using the Dirichlet Prior model. It considers only documents that contain the query term.\
   - The results are stored in the `query_results` list, which contains tuples of document IDs and their corresponding scores.\
   - The `query_results` list is then sorted in descending order of scores.\
   - The top 5 results for each query are displayed, showing the document ID and score.\
   - The precision in the top 5 results is calculated as the ratio of relevant documents (the first 5 inaugural addresses) found in the top 5 results.\
9. Display Results:\
   - After processing all queries for a given "mu" value, the code prints the results and precision for that "mu" value.\
10. Repeat for Different Mu Values:\
    - The entire process is repeated for the two values of "mu" specified in `mu_values`.\
Overall, the code implements a basic information retrieval system using the Dirichlet Prior model to rank documents based on the relevance of query terms and evaluates its performance by calculating precision in the top 5 results for each query. The code allows users to experiment with different "mu" values to observe their impact on retrieval results.}
